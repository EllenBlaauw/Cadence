## Phase 2: Music Recommendation & Initial Nudges

### Topic: Music Recommendation Logic

* [ ] Task 2.1.2: Implement logic to select a playlist based on the detected mood from Phase 1.
* [ ] Task 2.1.3: Display the recommended playlist title and a few sample song names in the UI.
* [ ] Task 2.1.4: Add a simple "How was this recommendation?" button (e.g., thumbs up/down) for future feedback loop.

### Topic: Digital Detox Nudges

* [ ] Task 2.2.1: Implement a Streamlit toggle button for "Study Mode" or "Mindful Break".
* [ ] Task 2.2.2: When the mode is active, display a clear message indicating simulated notification pausing (e.g., "Notifications temporarily paused for 30 minutes").
* [ ] Task 2.2.3: Curate a list of pre-written, age-appropriate, human-centric activity suggestions (e.g., "Read a book," "Call a family member," "Go for a walk," "Work on a creative hobby").
* [ ] Task 2.2.4: Display these suggestions conditionally based on the activated mode or general user interaction (e.g., after some time spent in the app).

## Phase 3: UI Refinement & Presentation Prep

### Topic: User Interface & Experience Enhancement

* [ ] Task 3.1.1: Review and refine all AI response messages to ensure an empowering, non-judgmental, and teen-friendly tone.
* [ ] Task 3.1.2: Enhance UI elements (icons, spacing, component layout) for better clarity and intuitive navigation.
* [ ] Task 3.1.3: Ensure consistent application of the soft, fun, happy, and inviting aesthetic across all UI components.
* [ ] Task 3.1.4: Conduct basic user flow testing to identify and fix any UI/UX issues.

### Topic: Presentation & Demo Preparation

* [ ] Task 3.2.1: Create presentation slides based on the project brief and outlined sections (problem, solution, MVP features, future).
* [ ] Task 3.2.2: Practice the live demonstration of the MVP, ensuring smooth transitions and clear explanations.
* [ ] Task 3.2.3: Prepare to discuss future enhancements and the scalability of the "Cadence" concept.
* [ ] Task 3.2.4: Final review of all project documentation (PROJECT.md, PLANNING.md, TASK.md, README.md).
