# Cadence

## Project for Sonoma Sonoma Hacks 4.0 Hackathon

Cadence is a smart wellness companion that uses AI and music to help teens understand and manage their emotions. 
It starts by analyzing journal entries and listening habits to detect your mood. 
Then, it recommends music that either reflects how you're feeling or gently guides you toward a better emotional state. 
Cadence also supports digital balanceâ€”helping teens set healthy screen time boundaries, avoid digital overload, and reconnect with the rhythm of real life.
It also suggests offline activities and lets users invite friends or family as accountability partners for support.
